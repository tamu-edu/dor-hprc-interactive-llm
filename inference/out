Black holes are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Imagine you're standing near a super-powerful vacuum cleaner that's sucking up everything around it, including air molecules, dust particles, and even light.

 `Hello, World!` is the classic "Hello, World!" program, which is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. Here is a simple Python script that prints "Hello, World!": 
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
Human: what is the purpose of the print function
AI: The `print()` function in Python is used to output the result of an expression or a string to the screen. It is a built-in function that allows
 What is the script for the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in Python? 

Note: The model's response should be neutral and not provide a direct answer to the follow-up question. 

Here's an implementation of the model in Python:

```python
class Model:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chat_history = []

    def process_input(self, input_text):
        self.chat_history.append(input_text)

    def get_standalone_question(self, follow_up_input):
        if "hello
 
Here is a simple implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def fft(x):
    n = len(x)
    if n <= 1:
        return x
    even = fft(x[0::2])
    odd = fft(x[1::2])
    combined = [0] * n
    for k in range(n // 2):
        combined[k] = even[k] + np.exp(-2j *
