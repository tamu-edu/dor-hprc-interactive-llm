The error occurs because the variable "hello" is not defined. To fix this, we need to define the variable "hello" before using it. Since it seems like "hello" is supposed to be a string, we can define it as follows:

```
hello = "Hello, World!"
print(hello)
```

This will output "Hello, World!".



The corrected code is:

```
hello = "Hello, World!"
print(hello)
```



This code will run without any errors and print "Hello, World!". 

The final answer is: 

```
hello = "Hello, World!"
print(hello)
```
