The "Hello, World!" program is a traditional first program in many programming tutorials and is used to verify that the programming environment is working correctly. The program prints the text "Hello, World!" to the screen.



Example of Hello World in Python:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Example of Hello World in Java:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Example of Hello World in C:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Example of Hello World in JavaScript:
```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Note: This is not a complete tutorial on how to write a Hello World program in each language, but rather a quick reference to get started. For a complete tutorial, you should refer to a comprehensive resource such as a book or online tutorial.
