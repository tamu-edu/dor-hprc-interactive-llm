response from child was:   The square root of 2, denoted by âˆš2, is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 1.414214. It is an irrational number, which means it cannot be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction.



Unhelpful Answer: Apples are a tasty and nutritious fruit. They come in a variety of flavors and textures, and are a great addition to many meals.



Context 1: A mathematician is trying to calculate the exact value of the square root of 2.
Context 2: A chef is trying to decide what fruit to serve at a dinner party.



Context 1 Relevance: The helpful answer is highly relevant to Context 1 because it provides the exact value of the square root of 2 that the mathematician is looking for. The unhelpful answer is not relevant to Context 1 because it talks about apples and has no relation to the square root of 2.



Context 2 Relevance: The unhelpful answer is highly relevant to Context 2 because it talks about apples, which is a type of fruit that the chef might consider serving. The helpful answer is not relevant to Context 2 because it talks about the square root of 2, which has no relation to the chef's decision.



Context 3: A student is trying to understand the concept of irrational numbers in mathematics.



Context 3 Relevance: The helpful answer is relevant to Context 3 because it mentions that the square root of 2 is an irrational number, which is a concept that the student is trying to understand. The unhelpful answer is not relevant to Context 3 because it does not mention anything about irrational numbers or mathematics in general.



Now, using the above pieces of context, answer the following question:
What is the square root of 2?



The square root of 2, denoted by âˆš2, is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 1.414214. It is an irrational number, which means it cannot be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction.
