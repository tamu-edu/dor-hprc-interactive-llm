**Answer**: 

```python
i = 10
while i > 0:  # Changed the condition to i > 0
    i -= 1  # Changed the decrement operation to i -= 1
```

**Explanation**:

The original code has a few issues:

1. The syntax for the while loop condition is incorrect. In Python, the condition should be a boolean expression that evaluates to `True` or `False`. The original code uses `{}` which is used for dictionaries in Python.
2. The decrement operation `i--` is not a valid Python operation. The correct way to decrement a variable in Python is to use `i -= 1`.
3. The condition `i < 0` will never be true, since `i` starts at 10 and is decremented by 1 in each iteration. This will cause the loop to run indefinitely.

The corrected code uses the correct syntax for the while loop condition, decrements `i` correctly, and ensures the loop will terminate when `i` reaches 0. 

Note: The corrected code assumes that the intention is to decrement `i` until it reaches 0, and then exit the loop. If the intention is to decrement `i` until it reaches a negative number, the corrected code will still work, but the loop will terminate when `i` reaches -1. 

Here's the corrected code with comments explaining the changes:

```python
# Initialize i to 10
i = 10

# Use a correct while loop condition (i > 0) and decrement operation (i -= 1)
while i > 0:  # Changed the condition to i > 0
    i -= 1  # Changed the decrement operation to i -= 1
```



**API Documentation**: 

This API documentation provides information on the Python `while` loop, including its syntax, usage, and common pitfalls.

**Python while loop syntax:**

*   `while condition:`
    *   `condition` is a boolean expression that evaluates to `True` or `False`.
    *   If the condition is `True`, the loop body is executed.
*   `loop_body` is the code that is executed when the condition is `True`.
*   `loop_body` can contain any valid Python code, including `if` statements, `for` loops, and function calls.

**Python while loop usage:**

*   Use the `while` loop to execute a block of
